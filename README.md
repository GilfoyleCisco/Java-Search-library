Java-Search-library by jayenashar

A Java search library, to search graphs and other state-space search problems

Includes two examples and generic implementations of the A* (A star) search, Uniform-Cost search, Best-First search, and BFS (breadth-first search) algorithms. A*, Uniform-Cost, and BFS are unidirectional and bi-directional. Also includes a PriorityQueue with efficient removal and a HashMap with K getKey(Object key).

Which search to use when: Use a bi-directional search (or Best-First) when the unidirectional search finds many paths; Use A* or Best-first when you have heuristics to guide the path-choosing; Use Best-First or BFS when you don't need optimality.
